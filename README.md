# macOS Local Development Setup

# ATTENTION: DEPRICATED!

These setup instructions are depricated! You can now use my new automatic installer at <a href="https://github.com/renekreijveld/macOS_PHP_local_development">Apache/NginX/MariaDB/PHP development stack for macOS</a>

After my MAMP PRO setup became very unstable I decided to setup my local development environment different.

I used various tips and recources from developer colleaugues.

I now run Apache, PHP (multiple versions: 5.6, 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4) and MariaDB locally on macOS extended with Zend OPcache, APCu Cache and XDebug.
Super fast and efficient setup and all sites run with HTTPS.

Setting up a new local website was never easier: simply create a new folder in Development/Sites and the local domain https://newfolder.dev.test automatically works with SSL. There's no need to modify the apache configuation, restart apache, edit your hosts file or add certificates. Everything works instantly.

This is the setup I used:
