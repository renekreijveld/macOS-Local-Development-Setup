# macOS Local Development Setup

After my MAMP PRO setup became very unstable I decided to setup my local development environment different.

I used various tips and recources from developer colleaugues.

I now run Apache, PHP (multiple versions: 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3) and MySQL locally on macOS extended with Zend OPcache, APCu Cache and XDebug.

This is the setup I used.
